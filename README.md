# Scada

Open-source font by Jovanny Lemonad

In 2005, Scada was designed as the corporate identity font for the Latvian design studio Scada.lv. In 2011 the design studio decided to make Scada a libre font. Over 6 months the font was reworked, improved and expanded into a family. It has a modern style, specifically designed for small sizes.
